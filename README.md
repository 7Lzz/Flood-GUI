# Flood-GUI repository

Main should be stable unless Flood Escape 2 updates.
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGetAsync"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ImMejor35/Flood-GUI/main/loader.lua")"main"
loadfile("Flood-GUI/Flood GUI v3")()
```

Testing branch may fix bugs sooner but higher chance of bugs and crashes.
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGetAsync"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ImMejor35/Flood-GUI/main/loader.lua")"testing"
loadfile("Flood-GUI/Flood GUI v3")()
```
